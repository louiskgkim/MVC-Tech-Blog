# MVC-Tech-Blog

## Description
CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. Architectural structure follows the Model View Controller (MVC) Paradigm while using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
